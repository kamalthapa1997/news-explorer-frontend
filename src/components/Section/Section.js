            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I started off in high school, diving into the world of
            science. Fast forward to today, and I'm a self-taught tech
            enthusiast. While my official CS journey took a detour, I found my
            way through a 10-month software engineering bootcamp, rocking the
            MERN stack. I love coding and problem-solving, and I'm always up for
            a challenge. Join me on this digital adventure - I'm all about tech,
            coffee, and making cool things happen! â˜•ðŸ’»
